**_What is an OIP?_**

An OIP is a proposal suggesting improvements or changes to the Orbs Network and all aspects of the Orbs project. OIPs are open and can be submitted for consideration by the Orbs community, the public at large, as well as by the Orbs core team.  

Note that OIPs are intended for major proposals and changes. To contribute on a more granular level, such as contributing codes, bug fixes, etc, feel free to submit directly on Github in accordance with the [Contributors Guide.](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-contributing)     

**_OIP Rationale_**

While the Orbs project has always been open-source and open to suggestions from the community in various forums, including [telegram](https://t.me/OrbsNetwork) chats, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sswGDYGBt5) and direct communication with Guardians and regular token holders, at the project’s current stage of development there is great value of having a dedicated place where suggestions can be organized and publicized. 

The intent is to facilitate an open and decentralized development process that enables everyone to contribute to the advancement of the Orbs project.  

**_OIP Categories_**

OIPs can be presented for any of the following categories:

- _Governance_: implement or change the rules governing the Orbs project’s governance process. 
- _Development_: technical proposals suggesting new features or changes to the Orbs project’s technology. This may include proposals relating to the protocol, architecture, proof-of-stake, consensus or the specifics of any products or services deployed on the Orbs Network or using Orbs’ technology. 
- _Parameters_: Suggested changes to the project’s existing parameters. For example, the initial votes on changes in the guardian minimum self-stake would fall under this category.   
- _Project Resources_: proposals to allocate project resources under community control (e.g., ORBS tokens allocated for a community development budget) for a specific project or purpose. 
- _Ecosystem_: Any suggestions to engage in collaboration with third parties, integrate Orbs or any of its products with another platform or protocol, or to undertake any other effort to expand or contract the project ecosystem.  

Some OIPs may fit into multiple categories. For example, a proposal to allocate a certain number of ORBS tokens to open a liquidity pool on a certain DEX would fall under both of the  Project Resources and Ecosystem categories. 

**_OIP Process_**

The parties involved in the process of an OIP are the person making the proposal (which may also be the ORBS team), the OIP editors who represent the Orbs core team and anyone interested in participating in the conversation. 

The following are the steps for a successful OIP: 

1. _Incubation/Vetting_: Post about your idea on the Orbs Discord for discussion. No format required. 
2. _Submit Draft OIP_:  Submit a draft OIP using the template below, via opening an issue at the OIP Github repository available at: https://github.com/orbs-network/OIPs. At submission, the proposal will be labeled “Draft”. 
3. _Review Process_:  The OIP Editors will review the draft OIP and suggest any changes, discuss any concerns. The community will also be invited to engage in these discussions. 
4. _Final Consensus_: Once the proposer, the OIP editors and all other interested parties have reached rough consensus that the proposal is in its final form and ready to be voted on by the community, the proposal will be labeled “Final”.   
5. _Community governance vote on SnapShot_: Once finalized, the proposal will be voted on by the entire community of Orbs PoS participants at the Orbs SnapShot space. Depending on the outcome, the proposal will be labeled “Accepted” or “Rejected”. 
6. _Execution_: Depending on the specifics of the proposal, the person responsible for implementing the proposal (e.g., the Orbs core team, the community or community representatives) will implement the proposal when practicable. The timing of the actual execution may vary depending on the complexity of the task and the amount of development required.  

**_OIP Template_**

All OIPs should include the following elements : 

- _Title_: Short title for your proposal. 
- _Category_: Indicate which of the categories above your proposal fits into. 
- _Description_: Provide an explanation of the proposal and what is being asked for. 
- _Benefits_: Provide the arguments for the proposal and why it will benefit the project and the community. 
- _Risks_: Provide any arguments against the proposal and risks it may present to the project or the community. 
- _Specification_: For technical proposals, include technical specifications and/or a link to such specifications.  
- _Responsible Parties_: indicate who will be responsible to execute the proposal (whether the Orbs team or other parties), what their roles will be and what specific actions they will be required to take.  
- _Voting_ : If you think your proposal should be subject to different voting standards than the current default on the Orbs SnapShot space, explain what the standard should be and why. 
- _Conclusion_: Short summary of the proposal. 
- _Reference Links_: Provide links to any documentation that relates to your proposal.
